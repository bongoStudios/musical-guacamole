There's a tree in your way! PREPARE FOR IMPAC- I mean uh... to dodge. 
Make a riding check for the jockey.








You maganed to dodge out of the way in time, good jockey, job.
You plastered your face into the tree, and lost your momentum. Oh well, you tried your best.

Is it a bird? 
No wait, is it a plane? 
No, IT'S A FLYING HAMMERHEAD SHARK WITH A MACHINEGUN!
(Make a luck check for the jockey)







Woah w-what?! Your cow had a SMAW rocket laucher? And she shot it down? WHAT THE F-? (bonus movement for the style points)
SHE'S HIT, SHE'S HIT! MAYDAY WE'RE GOING DOWN-- Oh no, she's fine, nevermind, but you stopped racing in the middle of the confusion. How unprofessional, have you never seen a flying hammerhead shark with a machine gun?

A rock, A ROCK! 
Oh. 
It's just a rock.
Let's hope the cow doesn't trip.
Make a dexterity check for the cow.






Good, that's good. It was previously a rock.  Now it's a dodged rock.
ROCK, MY GREATEST ENEMY, YOU HAVE FOOLED ME ONCE AGAIN!

A brown figure, sweeping down from the endless expanse that is the bright blue sky, crashes down in front of you.
It's him.
Your greatest enemy.
The fiercest adversary.
Your ultimate nemesis.
Obi-wan Kenobi
"Hello there." He whispers, mockingly, with his characteristic grin.
Compelled by his jedi prowess, you subconsciously make an intelligence check.



Through quick reflexes and careful p'rceptiveness, thee didst maketh shift to gain a holdeth of the situation in rec'rd timeth, allowing the tipeth of thy blade to slightly punctureth Obi-wan Kenobi's chest, and th'ref're, winneth the establisheth'd rivalry yond wast didst starteth countless years ago.
"GENERAL KENOBI!" You shout, in anger, attempting to cut him with your sword. But it is a futile attempt, an opportunistic shot already has you kneeling on the ground, and the last thing you see: his mocking grin. (you wake up three seconds after that)

What seems like an old lady walk in front of you just as you're passing, and you hit her with your cow. How unfortunate.
You stop to check if she's ok, and the woman reveals her big-nosed face, spouting from her mouth vile curses:
"Damn you, youngsters, you've ruined everything. You shall not leave my realm unscathed!"
"Polymorph!" she shouts, pointing her broom in your cow's direction, forcing you to make a willpower check.







Ha! Witch, you fool! My cow is immune to your futile attempts at magic! But she's a little dizzy it seems, let's give her some time to cool off.
Nothing happened? Oh, wait. Crap. The cow is now a giant raccoon with a pterodactyl head. How convenient.

The sky opens in a circular fashion as heavenly light lightly caresses your pores, and you feel as if a celestial being is coming down from above to greet you.
Because it is.
It's him, Morgan Freeman.
"Hello, my child." -he says- "You see, I have to attend to an imperative matter that cannot have even the slightest delay."
"So, with that said, would you mind handing me your cow?"
Against the godly charisma of this man, your body is not responding to your orders, you must overcome it to keep on racing!





You did it. You pushed your mind to the limit and managed to control yourself. You've kept your cow after spewing out, with great efforts, the words: "Sorry Freeman but I'm in a rush right now. My apologies." At least seen the great face of the Freeman gave you a little morale boost.
The old geezer, how dare he. I couldn't resist, I failed. I gave him the cow. Later, you see the cow returning to you, after a very long time. At least you can keep racing.

An indian man is walking with a cactus in the middle of the path...
But then, he falls on his knees
Knowing that he is in danger, he gets up and starts running to the left.
You then notice that the cactus is still on the path, thinking what may happen, you get an idea.
THE COW IS GONNA RUN OVER THAT CACTUS.
In just a fraction of seconds, you react and try to make the cow not run over it.
Make a dexterity roll.




The cow gently caresses the cactus without the spikes piercing the cow's skin.
The cow runs over the cactus and ALL the spikes pierce the cow's skin, the cow starts screaming and you stop it and start removing every spike.
